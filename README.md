AWS Incident Response Playbooks

A playbook is a predefined step-by-step guide to responding to specific incidents. Below are a few AWS IR playbooks:

1. AWS S3 Data Breach Playbook

Detection: Use AWS GuardDuty to detect unauthorized access.

Containment: Restrict bucket permissions and enable encryption.

Eradication & Recovery: Identify compromised IAM credentials and rotate them.

Post-Incident Analysis: Review logs in AWS CloudTrail and update access policies.

2. AWS IAM Credential Compromise Playbook

Detection: Monitor AWS Security Hub for unusual IAM activity.

Containment: Disable or rotate affected IAM credentials.

Eradication & Recovery: Review and revoke unnecessary IAM permissions.

Post-Incident Analysis: Implement MFA and tighten IAM policies.

3. EC2 Instance Compromise Playbook

Detection: Use Amazon Detective and AWS CloudTrail to check for suspicious activity.

Containment: Isolate the compromised instance by removing it from the network.

Eradication & Recovery: Patch vulnerabilities and deploy a fresh, secure instance.

Post-Incident Analysis: Implement security baselines and use AWS Systems Manager for monitoring.
